# EmotionAugmentation-ISEAR
This repository provides data augmentation code from the paper "Enhancing Emotion Classification on the ISEAR Dataset Using Fine-Tuning and Data Augmentation with Hybrid Transformer Models." Techniques here are optimized for Electra Base, XLNet Base, RoBERTa Base, T5 Base, DeBERTa V3 Large, and CNN-enhanced variants of these models.
This repository also conatian the augmented ISEAR dataset named "combined dataset".
